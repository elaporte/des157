	<p>I purchase many outfits from <a href="http://www.tobi.com">tobi.com</a>, an online-only clothing store that is relatively cheap and ships quickly aka perfect for a college student! When it comes to check out, some sites can be too long, or reset everything with the accidental click of one button, or just be truly unattractive. As far as Bill Derouchey's guidelines for interface design go, Tobi checks out. <br/><br/>
	<em>Here's why:</em> As far as hierarchy goes, Tobi uses color to highlight the important fields and using uniform coloring for the fields of equal importance. For example, the input boxes are white and the checkout button is black, drawing the user to the most important function on the page. Next, the clean black and white interface makes legibility and clarity high. It is a clean interface that allows the user to get from point A to point B as smoothy as possible. The interface does not display anymore advertisements or products that aren't relevant to checkout, making the process as straightforward and non-distracting as possible. The spacing is very clean, keeping the user's entries on the left and the static details on the right.

	<h2>Evaluating Pintrest User Interface</h2>
		<img src="pintrest2.jpg" alt="pintrest" width="600" height="283">
		<p>The Pintrest user interface is first foremost clean. The white background with the simple red p logo in the top left corner make for a simple layout that is content-focused. The large search bar makes it easy for the user to find exactly what their looking for without hunting for a small magnifying glass icon. The spacing between each post on Pintrest allows for good readability and visual spacing for the user to not feel overwhelmed. Simple san-serif fonts at good sizes and weights make each item uniform and easy to read. The hover feature over each piece of content gives the user a quick and easy way to form a board without entering each individual post. <br/><br/>
		When you want to access your personal profile, the icon of a head makes it easy to find. It lists your boards in the order they were created. On your mobile device, your latest pins and your common tags are the first thing you see, making it easy to continue your search for more items of one category. This is also much better access for a smaller screen.<br/><br/>
		Pintrest has been a great resource for its collectivity of everything in one space. The interace is clean and easy with great emphasis on the content and less on the text. I would recommend Pintrest for people of all ages and all tech-savvyness because of its easy usability.</p>
