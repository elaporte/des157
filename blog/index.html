	<h2>Evaluating Pintrest User Interface</h2>
		<img src="pintrest.png" alt="pintrest" width="600px" height="282px">
		<p>The Pintrest user interface is first foremost clean. The white background with the simple red p logo in the top left corner make for a simple layout that is content-focused. The large search bar makes it easy for the user to find exactly what their looking for without hunting for a small magnifying glass icon. The spacing between each post on Pintrest allows for good readability and visual spacing for the user to not feel overwhelmed. Simple san-serif fonts at good sizes and weights make each item uniform and easy to read. The hover feature over each piece of content gives the user a quick and easy way to form a board without entering each individual post. <br/><br/>
		When you want to access your personal profile, the icon of a head makes it easy to find. It lists your boards in the order they were created. On your mobile device, your latest pins and your common tags are the first thing you see, making it easy to continue your search for more items of one category. This is also much better access for a smaller screen.<br/><br/>
		Pintrest has been a great resource for its collectivity of everything in one space. The interace is clean and easy with great emphasis on the content and less on the text. I would recommend Pintrest for people of all ages and all tech-savvyness because of its easy usability.</p>
