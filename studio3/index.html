    <h1>This fall, I studied abroad in Madrid and was lucky enough to travel to other countries on most weekends. This is my collection of postcards from most of the places I went. I've highlighted a few favorites for you to check out. Enjoy!</h1>

          <div id="amsterdamDesc">
            <img src="amsterdam.jpeg" alt="Amsterdam">
            <p>Amsterdam is easily the craziest city I've ever been to. Beautiful canals, some dank food, cafes and "coffee shops", Amsterdam has it all. I went to Amsterdam during the first week of December so it was cold and gloomy but still such a lively city. The Red Light District is exactly what you imagine it to be while simultaneously being so unpredictable. If you get a chance to go for yourself, I won't spoil it. During the spring time, Amsterdam is home to a beautiful tulip festival but I just got to look at some plastic ones. If you're looking for the true opposite of conservative, Amsterdam will be the best host.

          <div id="budapestDesc">
            <img src="budapest.jpeg" alt="Budapest">
            <p>Budapest is an incredible city, one filled with so much war history and stories of iconic architecture being built, bombed and rebuilt. The Danube river divides the Buda side and the Pest side, pronounced Pesh-ed if you were wondering. The breath-taking Parliament building directly faces the palace on the other side of the river, creating a landscape you truly can't capture in one image. The Jewish Quarter has some great nightlife, full of middle-eastern food and bars created from the ruins.

          <div id="dublinDesc">
            <img src="dublin.jpeg" alt="Dublin">
            <p>Dublin was a very memorable weekend trip for me. My dad's girlfriend lives in Dublin so I spent the weekened visiting the two of them. Despite the accurate tales of the constantly-rainy Ireland, Dublin is one of the most breath-takingly green cities you'll ever find. We spent one afternoon at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin at St. James Gate and learned all about yeast and hops and barley while sipping on a deliciously dark beer. Absolutely worth the tour cost, and make sure you don't miss out on the roof-top bar!

          <div id="dubrovnikDesc">
            <img src="dubrovnik.jpeg" alt="Dubrovnik">
            <p>Dubrokvnik, and Croatia as a whole, were two of the most underrated places I have ever been. This tiny town along the water is one of the friendliest, most aesthetically pleasing places and you'd never guess it was home to brutal war attacks within the last two and a half decades. Breaking free from Yugoslavia, Croatia stands stonger than ever, attracting tourism and bringing publicity to the Balkans.

          <div id="valenciaDesc">
            <img src="valencia.jpeg" alt="Valencia">
            <p>Valencia is famous for being a beautiful beach town on the coast of Eastern Spain. Of course, I went in November so it was pouring and deserted. However! No matter what season you go, you will always be able to find some of the best dishes of Paella that Spain has to offer. Filled with seafood, rice, veggies, and spice, you absolutely cannot miss out on this delicacy. Find a restaurant serving "menu del dia", sit your butt down and get ready for the cheapest, most delicious, three-course meal of your life.
